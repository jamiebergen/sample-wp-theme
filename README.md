Sample WordPress Theme
===

This is a minimal WordPress sample theme intended to demonstrate good practices in theme development. Use it as-is for a blog, or extend it into a full-featured site.

The theme was built from the `_s` starter theme (also known as `underscores`). Features include:

* Sass: Styles are organized in modular `.scss` files and compiled using the [Sass CSS preprocessor](https://sass-lang.com/).
* Gulp: Makes use of [WP-Gulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp), an easy-to-use WordPress Gulp boilerplate. This enables live browser reloads using BrowserSync, Sass to CSS conversion, autoprefixing, CSS minification, JS concatenation, and image minification, among other things.
* Modern CSS: Page layouts were achieved using CSS Grid, while Flexbox was used to align content within elements. (No need for a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Foundation.)
* !!!TO DO: Simple mobile menu
* !!!TO DO: Responsive typography using a Sass mixin
* !!!TO DO: Change header background and font colors via the customizer
